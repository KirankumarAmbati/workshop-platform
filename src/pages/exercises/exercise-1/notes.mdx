## Goals of this Exercise

#### Goal 1 - Practice building blocks of React

Learn how to make React components and render some markup from them. Learn how to declare and update state in React.

#### Goal 2 - Practice working with a React codebase.

Learn how to import components from different files. Understand what are props and how they
can be passed from one component to its children components.


## Problems that you might face

#### 1. useState is not defined

This happens when you don't import `useState` from React npm package. Make sure
that the following code snippet is present in the playground.js file.

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

#### 2. Test failed because data-testid="counter" is not found

For the tests to work you need to use the helper components present in the components.js
file. For your ease, they were already imported in the playground.js file.
